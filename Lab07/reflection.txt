A SHORT PERSONAL REFLECTION FOR TESTING PROCESS

It contributed to writing the code with less problems in the first place
The testIsOrdered method spotted some error
By entering values with hand actually I did not make any mistakes as such
I spotted problems in my entered string for target while checking manually
Preparing test methods was a bit time taking compared to my previous attempts
As this time was not the first time like previous attempt is was definetly faster
